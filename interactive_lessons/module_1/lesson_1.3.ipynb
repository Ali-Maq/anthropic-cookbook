    "- ✅ Use 0.7-1.0 for: Creative writing, brainstorming\n",
    "- ❌ Don't use temperature with top_p\n",

    "### Max Tokens\n",
    "- ✅ Set higher than needed, let Claude finish naturally\n",
    "- ✅ Check `stop_reason` to verify completeness\n",
    "- ✅ Use `usage.output_tokens` to track actual length\n",
    "- ❌ Don't set too low and cut off responses\n",

    "### Stop Sequences\n",
    "- ✅ Use for structured output\n",
    "- ✅ Use to limit length precisely\n",
    "- ✅ Can have multiple stop sequences\n",

    "### What You Learned:\n",
    "- ✅ How temperature controls randomness (0 = consistent, 1 = creative)\n",
    "- ✅ Max tokens sets length limits\n",
    "- ✅ Stop sequences control output endpoints\n",
    "- ✅ Top-p for advanced sampling\n",
    "- ✅ When to use each parameter\n",
    "- ✅ Building consistent extractors\n",

    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "1. **Temperature = creativity dial** (0 to 1)\n",
    "2. **Max tokens = length limit** (check stop_reason)\n",
    "3. **Stop sequences = custom endpoints** (for structured output)\n",
    "4. **Low temp = consistency** (for data extraction)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",

    "## 🤔 Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When would you use temperature=0.0 vs temperature=1.0?\n",
    "2. What happens if max_tokens is too small?\n",
    "3. How can you tell if a response was cut off?\n",
    "4. Give 3 examples of good stop sequences.\n",
    "5. Why shouldn't you use temperature and top_p together?\n",
